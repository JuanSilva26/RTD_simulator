# RTD Simulator Modernization Roadmap

## 1. Modular, SOLID-Inspired Architecture

- [x] **Refactor codebase** to strictly separate Model, View, Controller (MVC) layers.
- [x] **Abstract base classes** for RTD models and analyzers; all new models/analyses must inherit interfaces.
- [x] **Dependency injection**: Pass model, plotter, and config objects via constructors to decouple components and ease testing.
- [x] **Plugin-ready design**: Use dynamic import/registration for models and analysis tools (Open/Closed Principle).

## 2. Profiling & Benchmarking

- [ ] **Integrate cProfile**: Wrap simulation and analysis calls, output .prof files for flamegraph tools.
- [ ] **Add line_profiler/pyinstrument**: Enable per-line timing for numerical routines; document usage in README.
- [ ] **Automated profiling scripts**: Provide scripts to benchmark common workflows and output bottleneck reports.

## 3. Data Handling Enhancements

- [x] **NumPy vectorization**: Refactor all array computations (IV, simulation, analysis) to use vectorized NumPy ops.
- [ ] **Memory-mapping**: For large/long simulations, use numpy.memmap for out-of-core data access.
- [ ] **Efficient export**: Batch data writes, support streaming to CSV/HDF5 for large datasets.

## 4. Plotting Optimization

- [x] **Matplotlib blitting**: Refactor real-time plots to use blitting for fast updates.
- [x] **Minimize artist count**: Batch data into single Line2D objects, reduce dynamic text/markers.
- [x] **Profile redraws**: Use Matplotlib's built-in timers to benchmark and optimize plot update speed.

## 5. Threaded/Background Simulation

- [x] **Move simulations to QThread/QThreadPool**: Prevent UI freezes by running long computations in background threads.
- [x] **Signal-slot communication**: Use PyQt signals to update UI safely from worker threads.
- [x] **Progress reporting**: Add progress bars/cancellation for long simulations.

## 6. Automated Testing & CI

- [ ] **pytest**: Write/expand unit and integration tests for all modules.
- [ ] **Mocking**: Use unittest.mock for hardware/external dependencies.
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI to run lint, type-check, and tests on push/PR.
- [ ] **Coverage**: Track and improve test coverage.

## 7. Plugin/Extensibility System

- [x] **Dynamic model/analysis loading**: Allow new RTD models and analysis tools to be added as plugins (no core code change).
- [x] **Plugin registry**: Maintain a registry for available models/analyses, auto-discover on startup.
- [ ] **Developer docs**: Document plugin API and provide templates.

## 8. Documentation & Developer Onboarding

- [x] **Update README**: Add architecture overview, profiling/testing instructions, and plugin guide.
- [x] **Docstrings**: Ensure all public classes/functions are documented.
- [ ] **Tutorials**: Provide Jupyter notebooks or scripts for common workflows and profiling.

# Implementation Plan

1. ~~Refactor architecture for SOLID/MVC and plugin readiness.~~
2. ~~Integrate profiling tools (cProfile, line_profiler, pyinstrument) and add example scripts.~~
3. ~~Vectorize and optimize data handling; add memory-mapping for large arrays.~~
4. ~~Refactor plotting for blitting and artist minimization.~~
5. ~~Move simulation to background threads with PyQt signal-slot for UI updates.~~
6. **Next Steps:**
   - [ ] Set up pytest infrastructure
   - [ ] Write initial test suite
   - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions
   - [ ] Add memory mapping for large simulations
   - [ ] Create developer documentation
   - [ ] Add example notebooks
